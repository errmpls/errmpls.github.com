headline_about: So what is this Err thing?
info_about:
- line: Err (rhymes with hair) was born in the summer of 2014 from all-caps Facebook comment threads, idealistic coffee dates, midnight run-ins on the street, and boozy candlelit scheming circles. We were a group of artists with a crystal clear passion, and a hazy idea. We knew that we believed in the art of our friends, and wanted to celebrate what they were creating. We knew that we wanted to make a space where good art met good vibes, and we knew that we wanted to help turn the emerging artist into the up-and-coming artist.
- line: Today, we are an expanding, engaged creative community, providing artists space on both page and stage. Our monthly events and handmade zines feature local artists of all mediums.
