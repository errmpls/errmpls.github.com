For the first of four nights of entertainment this month, Err teams up with Lolo's Ghost to provide an evening full of great local music.

Courtney Yasmineh:: Familiar, visceral, muscular, fresh, highly energized.
Lolo's Ghost:: Moody, dark, soulful and beautiful songs.
Nathan Walker:: Sounds like John Prine dunking on Galaxie 500 in the NBA Finals.
Hello Como:: Bluesy folk-rock emerging from a dank Como Park basement.
The Floating Perspectives:: Indie Power Folk Pop.
