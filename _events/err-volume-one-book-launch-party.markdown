After two years of monthly events that have featured over one hundred emerging artists, Err Artist Collective is publishing a book!

"Err: Volume One" will be unveiled at a book launch party on March 15 at honey mpls and will be available in local bookstores following the release.

The launch party will feature readings from "Err: Volume One" along with performances by three local bands, Judy Gloom, The Carnivorous Birds, and Fletcher Magellan. The event is free, and all interested and interesting people are invited to celebrate some amazing Twin Cities talent. 

Books will be available for purchase for $20. Free admission.
