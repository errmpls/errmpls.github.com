Since our first event in 2014, Err has featured the work of over one hundred Twin Cities artists at our monthly events and accompanying handbound zine, Errata. 

A distillation of every Err event from 2014 - 2016, Err: Volume One brings the artwork, poetry, short stories, lyrics, comedy, and photographs of Err artists together in one full-color, 320-page book.
