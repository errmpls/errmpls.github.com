Brand Witch // Shannon Fletcher’s fingerprints are literally all over this book. As are a few of her feline roommates’ hairs.  She’s a left-handed leftist, a poet, and a copywriter living and working in Minneapolis.  She’s a sinner; she’s a saint; she’s a Scorpio.  She smells like vetiver, hot sauce, and makeup setting spray.
