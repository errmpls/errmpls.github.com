Grace Lansing is an artist, activist, and accident waiting to happen. She believes in grassroots organizations and hopes to channel creative energy into her own non-profit one day. Grace will sing 4 Non Blondes during every good moment until she dies, and all her weird great friends will sing it at her funeral until their voices run out.
