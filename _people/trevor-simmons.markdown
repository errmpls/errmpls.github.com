Trevor Simmons debases the everlasting burial rite with funked up puns, unpardonable dad-jokes and an occasional poem. He comes with several modes of mental superstition, a mangled big toe and goes freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families. He digs crow-pose, Chinaski and kind hearted criminals.
